# Crude Gasoline Dynamics: Cointegration Forecasting for Energy Arbitrage

Welcome to our Time Series Forecasting repository, where we analyze and compare the performance of ECM, VAR, ARIMAX, and LSTM models for predicting gasoline prices. This project applies econometric and deep learning approaches to assess forecasting accuracy and profitability.

## Project Overview
This repository includes a structured time series forecasting analysis, focusing on different statistical and machine learning models. The analysis is divided into the following components:

1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing trends, seasonality, and statistical properties.

2️⃣ ECM, VAR, and ARIMAX Models – Implemented in R Markdown and compiled into a PDF and HTML report.

3️⃣ LSTM Model – Implemented in Jupyter Notebook (Python) with an HTML output.

4️⃣ Results & Conclusion – Comparing model performance and cumulative profits.

This modular structure ensures efficient collaboration, allowing different components to be worked on independently while producing a unified analysis.
